The solution is to use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison checks both value and type, preventing the unexpected behavior caused by type juggling.  This ensures that '0' and false are treated as distinct values.

```php
<?php
// Buggy code
if ('0' == false) {
  echo "'0' is equal to false (incorrect)";
}

// Solution
if ('0' === false) {
  echo "'0' is equal to false (incorrect)";
} else {
  echo "'0' is NOT equal to false (correct)";
}

//Further demonstrating the issue
$valueFromForm = $_POST['myValue']; // Could be '0' from a form or database
if ($valueFromForm == false) {
    echo 'Value is considered false (incorrect)';
} else {
    echo 'Value is considered true (correct if $valueFromForm is not 0, false otherwise)';
}

// Solution using strict comparison
if ($valueFromForm === false) {
    echo 'Value is considered false (correct)';
} else {
    echo 'Value is considered true (correct if $valueFromForm is not 0, false otherwise)';
}
?>
```
